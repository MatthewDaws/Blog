# Matt's Blog

I have replaced my website with a new static site.  But what to do about the blog?  I have quickly rolled my own: some Python scripts which recreate a minimal working version of Jekyll.

### Reminders

- Build as `python -m build`
- Use `python -m build --clean` to clean the output directory
- Copy the `css` folder from the main website to see a better local version when testing

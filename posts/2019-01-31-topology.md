Reading a paper with my office mate, we ended up having a discussion about the notion of an "open neighbourhood base"
in a topological space.  For example, I might informally say that the weak topology on a Banach space $E$
has, around a point $x$, an open neighbourhood base is given by the sets
\[ \{y\in E : |f_i(x-y)|<\epsilon \ (1\leq i\leq n) \} \]
where $f_i$ are members of $E^*$ and $\epsilon > 0$.

This raises a natural question:

> Suppose we have a set $X$ and for each $x\in X$ we have specified a collection
$U_x$ of subsets of $X$, such that $A\in U_x \implies x\in A$.
When is there a topology on $X$ such that $U_x$ are the "basic open neighbourhoods" of $x$?

What precisely do we mean by this?  I think this is a little unclear, so let's be precise.  We seek
a topology $\tau$ on $X$ so that:

- (1) Each member of $U_x$ is in $\tau$; and
- (2) Each $U_x$ should be a [filter-base](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_(mathematics)#Filter_on_a_set)
for the collection of all neighbourhoods of $x$.  That is, if $x \in B \subseteq A \subseteq X$
with $B\in\tau$ then there is $C\in U_x$ with $C\subseteq A$.  Clearly it suffices to
consider the cases when $A=B$.

Consider the topology, say $\tau_0$, generated by all the sets $\newcommand{\mc}{\mathcal}
\mc U = \{U : U\in U_x \ (x\in X) \}$
that is, members of $\tau_0$ are arbitrary unions of sets of the norm $V_1\cap\cdots\cap V_n$ for
$V_i\in\mc U$.  Condition (1) holds, and condition (2) will hold exactly when, given $V_i\in\mc U$
each containing $x$, there is $A\in U_x$ with $A\subseteq V_1\cap\cdots\cap V_n$.  In particular:

- (2a) Given $A_1,\cdots,A_n\in U_x$ there is $A\in U_x$ with $A\subseteq A_1\cap\cdots\cap A_n$;
- (2b) Given $B\in U_y$ with $x\in B$, there is $A\in U_x$ with $A\subseteq B$;

These two conditions then imply (2), for given $V_i\in\mc U$ each containing $x$, by (2b) we
can find $A_i\in U_x$ with $A_i\subseteq V_i$, and then by (2a) there is $A\in U_x$ with
$A\subseteq A_1\cap\cdots\cap A_n \subseteq V_1\cap\cdots\cap V_n$.

Consider now
\[ \tau_1 = \{ A\subseteq X : x\in A\implies\exists\,B\in U_x, \ B\subseteq A\}. \]
Then $\tau_1$ contains $\emptyset$ and $X$, and is obviously closed under unions.  Condition (2a)
implies that $\tau_1$ is closed under finite intersections, that is, that $\tau_1$ is a topology.
If $A\in\tau$ and $x\in A$ then by (2), there is $C\in U_x$ with $C\subseteq A$; thus $A\in \tau_1$.
Hence $\tau_0 \subseteq \tau \subseteq \tau_1$.

Finally, given $A\in\tau_1$, if $x\in A$ then there is $B\in U_x\subseteq\mc U$ with $B\subseteq A$,
and so $A$ is the union of members of $\mc U$, so $A\in\tau_0$.  We conclude that our putative
topology $\tau$ is unique, and equals $\tau_0$ (or $\tau_1$).  Further, we have shown that $\tau$
exists exactly when (2a) and (2b) hold (which are conditions on the families $U_x$).

Let us return to the weak topology.  (2a) is clear, but to show (2b) is a little exercise
in picking epsilons.

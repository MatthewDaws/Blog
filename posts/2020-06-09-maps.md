Because of lockdown, and the desire to occasionally get out the house, I have been exploring the local area more closely.  The following are some nice resources:

- [StreetMap.co.uk](https://www.streetmap.co.uk/) : Online access to OS maps of various scales.
- [Rights of way in Calderdale](https://www.calderdale.gov.uk/v2/residents/transport-and-streets/public-rights-way/definitive-map-and-statement) : You cannot see the "definitive map" online, but...
- [Leisure and culture map](https://www.calderdale.gov.uk/v2/maps-new/leisure-and-culture-map) : Gives a "non-definitive" map.  Seems the same as OS maps to me, but perhaps easier to check exact details on.

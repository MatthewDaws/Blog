The [2nd part](2020-01-28-grad-course.html) of my talk to postgraduate students is all about statistics, particularly hypothesis testing, and why I like Bayesian approaches.
As the room allocated was long and thin with whiteboards only on the long walls, I decided that a chalk-and-talk would just lead to neck ache in my audience.

So I want with a [beamer talk (pdf of slides)](public/talk1.pdf) which inevitably lead to me finishing early.  I guess no-one minded this.

A mini-bibliography:

- I still really enjoy my undergraduate lecture notes curtesy of [Prof. Richard Weber](http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~rrw1/stats/) (I feel old to see that Prof Weber is now retired...)
- Rice, "Mathematical Statistics And Data Analysis" which said lecture notes follow moderately closely.  [Amazon link](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Mathematical-Statistics-Analysis-Duxbury-Advanced/dp/0534399428).  Also available in the UCLAN library.
- A wonderful book is [MacKay, Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms](http://www.inference.org.uk/mackay/itila/p0.html).  Available in electronic format for free.
- A more straight-up introduction to Bayesian thought is Sivia and Skilling, "Data Analysis: A Bayesian Tutorial".  [Amazon link](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Data-Analysis-Bayesian-Devinderjit-Sivia/dp/0198568320).  This book blends some philosophical thoughts (but not overly heavy) with practical and interesting advanced statistics.
I believe it's available online from one of the online libraries UCLAN subscribes to (and/or is in the library).
- A more heavy-weight alternative is Bayesian Data Analysis, Third Edition by the gang of six.  [Amazon link](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bayesian-Analysis-Chapman-Statistical-Science/dp/1439840954).
- A bed-time book is the excellent Nate Silver's book "The signal and the noise".  [Amazon link](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Signal-Noise-Art-Science-Prediction/dp/0141975652).  Everyone should read this.

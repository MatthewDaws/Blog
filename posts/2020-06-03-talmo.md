I've spent yesterday afternoon and this morning attending the [TALMO](http://talmo.uk/) conference, from the comfort of my home office, via Zoom.  The extremely efficient organisers have already got many of the presentations uploaded to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCC1yB03N8tAjQiUyed5iw9g).

Some links which I made during the talks:

- [OBS Virtualcam](https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/obs-virtualcam.949/) : OBS is a great (free) screen recorder which allows e.g. composing different inputs (so overlaying a webcam image at an arbitrary place in a screen capture of just one window).  The "Virtualcam" is an output which fakes up a new webcam on your system, hence allowing you to pipe the OBS output into any application which uses a webcam.
- [Accessibility talk slides](https://stem-enable.github.io/Accessibility-of-maths-e-resources/index.html) : This has been rumbling away in the background, but an unhappy confluence of a looming deadline just as we add more things online makes it more important.  Particularly discussed was [Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/).  Perhaps it is time to move all my lecture notes to a new format.  But it's the input of time required, and a new toolchain to learn...
- [Xournal++](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp/wiki/User-Manual) (a fork of Xournal into C++ I think leads to the title) is a FOSS PDF annotator that supports LaTeX.  Next time I am marking work I will investigate this.
- There was a question asking about Tablets.  Suggestions included Wacom tablets, and those by [xp-pen](https://www.amazon.co.uk/XP-Pen-Drawing-Graphic-Battery-free-Shortcuts/dp/B0814MC827/)
- [Videos to help students adapt from A-Levels](http://www.personal.reading.ac.uk/~smsglais/Covid-19_AL-Studies_Videos_etc_to_support_new_intake_to_UG_mathematical_sciences_programmes_in_Autumn_2020.pdf) which is especially important this year, as most students will have missed the end of their A-Level studies.  There was some talk that the [AMSP](https://amsp.org.uk/) would be doing something, but I couldn't find much (at a brief glance).

title: Raspberry Pi audio
---

My son and I are attempting to follow the [instructions in Pi Mag 88](https://magpi.raspberrypi.org/articles/retro-computing-with-raspberry-pi-4-in-the-magpi-issue-88) to build a voice activated LED-powered Christmas tree decoration.  This is part of what I suspect shall be many posts documenting my attempts to actually use the couple of Raspberry Pis which we own.

Up first is recording audio on the Pi.  I purchased [this cheap USB microphone](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/mini-usb-microphone).  It works, but it's rather poor quality.  With a bit more research, I might have bought a [Playstation Eye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Eye) which is nearly as cheap, and apparently pretty much works out the box with the Pi.  We played with the Microphone on our Pi 3 connected up to monitor, keyboard etc. but eventually we want to use my Pi 0 in headless mode.

## Access a Pi via SSH

Install Raspberian and boot the Pi 0.  With only one USB port and no working hub, you can run the initial setup with a keyboard quite easily.  An internet search will reveal how to move the mouse cursor with the keyboard.  Using the Preferences, enable SSH access.  We can now run the Pi 0 headless and SSH in.  I use [Putty](https://www.putty.org/) as a windows SSH client.

To use function keys (which we'll want to use shortly) you need to run Putty with the "keyboard" option as ["Xterm R6"](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=52713) (and not "linux"...)

## Checking the microphone

Plug in the USB microphone, reboot the Pi 0, and SSH in.  Run

> arecord -l

I got the following:

    **** List of CAPTURE Hardware Devices ****
    card 1: Device [USB PnP Sound Device], device 0: USB Audio [USB Audio]
      Subdevices: 1/1
      Subdevice #0: subdevice #0

The USB microphone shows up as "card 1" for me.  Now run

> alsamixer -c 1

to access the mixer for card 1.  Here we need our function keys to work.  Increase the capture level to 100.

To make a test recording:

> arecord -D hw:1,0 -d 5 -f cd test.wav -c 1

This makes a 5 second recording, cd quality, mono "-c 1", using card 1, subdevice 0.  Once copied to my computer and loaded into [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) the result is okay, though _very_ quiet.

## Software

We'll now need to install [Portaudio](http://www.portaudio.com/).  I am following the instructions [here](http://docs.kitt.ai/snowboy/#access-microphone):

> sudo apt-get install python-pyaudio python3-pyaudio sox

> sudo pip3 install pyaudio

_Maybe_ also:

> sudo apt-get install libasound-dev

> sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev

Assuming 

> aplay -l

Shows card 0, subdevice 0 as a suitable playback device (we won't actually use playback) and with card 1, subdevice 0 as the microphone (as above) we now edit (or create)

> nano ~/.asoundrc

and change / create the file to have contents:

    pcm.!default {
    type asym
    playback.pcm {
        type plug
        slave.pcm "hw:0,0"
    }
    capture.pcm {
        type plug
        slave.pcm "hw:1,0"
    }
    }

Then run

> rec test.wav

and check it works.

## Getting snowboy working

I wanted to play with [SnowBoy](https://snowboy.kitt.ai/) which is an offline "hot word" detector (rather than following the Pi Mag's suggestion of an electrical button to make the Pi listen for commands).

First we [download](http://docs.kitt.ai/snowboy/#downloads) the file for Raspberry pis, then scp it over:

> scp .\snowboy-rpi-arm-raspbian-8.0-1.1.1.tar.bz2 pi@192.168.1.17:./snowboy.tar.bz2

Then decompress and extract:

> bzip2 -d snowboy.tar.bz2

> tar xvf snowboy.tar

We'll need some more libraries:

> sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev

This is Python 2 only, and I get a stream of error messages.  A bit of debugging shows that we get a stream of non-fatal errors when initialising the `pyaudio.PyAudio()` object.  The fatal error comes from trying to open the audio input at 16000Hz.  44kHz works fine.  However, if I manually change the recording to 44kHz no speech recognition occurs: probably because the "model" and "data" are not incompatible.

At this point, I get bored with Python 2, and wonder if I can get Python 3 working, before we start some serious re-engineering of the project.  The [GitHub](https://github.com/kitt-ai/snowboy) repo has Python 3 support, but it needs building.  Thankfully [sigmadel](https://www.sigmdel.ca/michel/ha/rpi/voice_rec_02_en.html) has nicely described the steps to do this.  I followed this up until the point after running Swig.  At this point, my aim is to extract a minimal working copy of the files needed for Python 3.  I copied all the files from `examples/Python3` to a new directory, and then fixed the missing symbolic links by copying the actual files over them.  The next post will explain what I did then.

A couple of new [research notes](https://github.com/MatthewDaws/Mathematics):

- Some notes on [inductive limits](https://github.com/MatthewDaws/Mathematics/tree/master/Inductive-Limits) of Banach spaces and algebras.  I don't have a use for this rather esoteric topic, but a couple of textbooks make (slightly) wrong claims, so I wrote up some notes and carefully checked how far we could get things to work.

- A quick proof showing how to get the [Kaplansky Density Theorem](https://github.com/MatthewDaws/Mathematics/tree/master/Kaplansky) by using Arens products, and "elementary" (for various values of elementary) $C^*$-algebra theory.

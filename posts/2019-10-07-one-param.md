A preprint [arXiv:1907.03661](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.03661) which has been on the arXiv for a while, but which is now submitted.  The paper is partly an exposition of some techniques for dealing with Analytic Generators of one-parameter isometry groups: as people explore Type III arguments in von Neumann algebras, I want to revisit these old(ish) ideas and show that developing theory can be rather useful.

My main motivation was the study of [locally compact quantum groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locally_compact_quantum_group) and in particular the fact that the antipode can be understood through studying the scaling group.  One of the facets of topological quantum group theory is the interaction between the $C^*$-algebraic and von Neumann algebraic theories; in particular we have an inclusion $\newcommand{\G}{\mathbb G}C_0(\G) \rightarrow L^\infty(\G)$ which intertwines the relevant scaling groups.  I show that in this general setup, there is a Kaplansky Density type result for the analytic generators involved.  The techniques of the proof also allow me to prove an "automatic normality" result, giving a description of $L^1_\sharp(\G)$ the natural dense $\ast$-subalgebra of $L^1(\G)$.

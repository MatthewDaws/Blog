There has, for more time than I care to think about, been a large, empty display board right outside my office.  My fellow corridor occupants, being (astro)physicists, actually have a culture of making posters, which are then perfect for displaying on said boards.  But what is a Mathematician to do?  I have been planning this for, again, longer than I care to remember, but finally here it is:

The evenings spent watching Masterchef and cutting out bits of paper were, well, almost worth it.  It occurs to me that the display of images on this site is not particularly "responsive", but who has the time?

The [Collatz Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) is well-known, and fun to play around with (especially into an introduction to programming class).  Some recent progress was [Tao's work](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2019/09/10/almost-all-collatz-orbits-attain-almost-bounded-values/) but this all is way outside my zone of expertise.  Still, I think it does make for a nice use of a notice board.
